# Getting Started with Next.js 14

Next.js 14 is the latest version of the popular React framework that makes building full-stack web applications simple and efficient. In this guide, we'll explore the key features and learn how to get started.

## What's New in Next.js 14?

Next.js 14 introduces several exciting features:

- **App Router**: A new routing system based on file-system
- **Server Components**: React components that run on the server
- **Improved Performance**: Better optimization and faster builds
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Better error messages and debugging

## Setting Up Your First Project

To create a new Next.js project, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript --tailwind --eslint
```

This command will create a new project with:
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- ESLint for code quality

## Understanding the App Router

The App Router is the new routing system in Next.js 14. It's based on the file system structure:

```
app/
├── layout.tsx      # Root layout
├── page.tsx        # Home page
├── about/
│   └── page.tsx    # About page
└── blog/
    └── [slug]/
        └── page.tsx # Dynamic blog post
```

## Server Components vs Client Components

Next.js 14 introduces Server Components by default. Here's the difference:

### Server Components
```tsx
// This runs on the server
export default function ServerComponent() {
  return <div>Server rendered content</div>
}
```

### Client Components
```tsx
'use client'

// This runs in the browser
export default function ClientComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>
}
```

## Data Fetching

Next.js 14 makes data fetching simple with async components:

```tsx
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  return res.json()
}

export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData()
  return <main>{/* render data */}</main>
}
```

## Styling with Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is included by default and provides utility classes:

```tsx
export default function StyledComponent() {
  return (
    <div className="flex min-h-screen items-center justify-center bg-gray-100">
      <div className="rounded-lg bg-white p-8 shadow-lg">
        <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900">
          Hello Next.js!
        </h1>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Deployment

Deploying your Next.js app is straightforward:

1. **Vercel** (Recommended): Connect your GitHub repository
2. **Netlify**: Build and deploy with `next build && next export`
3. **Docker**: Use the official Next.js Docker image

## Best Practices

1. **Use TypeScript**: For better developer experience and type safety
2. **Implement SEO**: Use metadata API for better search engine optimization
3. **Optimize Images**: Use Next.js Image component for automatic optimization
4. **Code Splitting**: Next.js handles this automatically
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Use tools like Lighthouse and Web Vitals

## Conclusion

Next.js 14 provides an excellent foundation for building modern web applications. With its App Router, Server Components, and improved performance, it's the go-to framework for React developers.
